## Introduction 
this guided project presented by Data Tutorials on YouTube. The project centers around the analysis of a pizza sales dataset, where the goal is to extract valuable insights for the company.

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to expand my knowledge and skills in Power BI. By delving into the analysis of the pizza sales dataset, I aim to gain practical experience and further my proficiency with Power BI tools.



## Problem Statement


This dashboard provides valuable assistance to pizza restaurants in understanding their customers better and analyzing the performance of their products. Restaurants can utilize this dashboard to determine the sales proportion for different types of pizzas and identify customer preferences.

Through diverse evaluations, restaurants can pinpoint areas for improvement, whether through enhancing product quality or diversifying the menu. The dashboard also aids them in identifying the best-selling varieties and those that require marketing or development efforts.

## Data Import and Cleaning

Upon importing the dataset into Power BI, a meticulous examination was performed to enhance data understanding. The process encompassed:

- Identifying outliers
- Handling null values
- Eliminating blank rows
- Ensuring the correct data type for each column

## Data Prepping and Analysis

Following data cleaning, the focus shifted to extracting insights. Business-related questions were formulated, and SQL queries were utilized to retrieve answers. Key analyses included:

- Total Revenue
- Total Average Value
- Total Pizza Sold
- Total Orders
- Average Pizza per Order
- Daily Trends for Total Orders
- Monthly Trends for Total Orders
- Percentage of sales by category
